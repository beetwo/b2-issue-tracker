There is currently no special view for adding organisations so the following steps
have to be folowed by user with administrative right through the admin interface.

Administrators can reach the Admin interface via a link at the top right of
the profile page. They will be greeted by an interface similar to the following screenshot:

![admin overview](../screenshots/admin_overview.png)

The actual interface might be slightly different, depending on the permissions
your user has configured.

From here the steps easy:

- Find the section _Organisations_ and either click on _Organisations_ to
  get a listing of all currently registered Organisations or use the "Add" shortcut.

- You will be presented with a form where you will be able to create a new organisation.
  Only a few fields (such as name and short name) are required and adminitrators are
  advised to only fill out the minimum required information.
  Locations, Logo etc. can all be safely skipped, organisation administrators can edit
  these properties through the main interface at a later point.

- One aspect of the form is important if you intend to invite users to the
  organisation right away. At the end of the organisation form you will find the following fields:
  ![admin inline invitations](../screenshots/admin_invitations.png)
  Here you are able to enter email addresses and choose the role the invited person will receive as
  soon as he signs up. It makes sense to invite a single email address during creation and assign
  him the _admin_ role for the organisation. This way he will be able to invite additional members
  to the organisation by himself.
