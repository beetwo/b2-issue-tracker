Similar to issues Toucan can also visualize the location of organizations.
A single organisation can have multiple locations and any number of members.
All details are visualized on this page.

The details of an organisation can be edited by organisation administrators. 
Members with administrative access to an organisation are identified with the 
admin label in the member list.
