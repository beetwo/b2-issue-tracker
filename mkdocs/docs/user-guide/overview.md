![issues overview](../screenshots/issue_overview.png)

This is the landing page for logged in users.

The view is split between a map and a issue list view. 
The map on the right hand side visualizes the locations of issues. 
The left hand side shows title, type, owner and organisations of the visible issues.
Issue can be selected by clicking the issue title on the left or the markers 
on the map. This brings the user to the issue detail page where most 
of the user interaction happens.
