![user profile page](../screenshots/profile_settings.png)


Here you can manage your preferences.

Change your email address, mobile phone number, view membership information 
and configure your notification settings.

While email and phone number should be self explanatory the notifications might 
need some clarification.

## Mention notifications

Other users can mentionyou on the Toucan platform by replying to issues and using 
*@+<your username>*. The same goes for the short name of your organisation.
Here you can configure the way you want to be notified of each event or disable 
notifications completely by disabling both options.

## Geographic notifications

Toucan can be configured to notify you of new issues inside a geographic area.
Click the map where you want the center to be and increase/decrease the radius (in km).
Optionally issues can also be filtered by type.
