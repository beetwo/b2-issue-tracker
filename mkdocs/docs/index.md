# Toucan Issue Tracker

## Introduction

The Toucan issue tracker is a web application that aims to enable 
cooperation between humanitarian organisations during crisis situations 
in a given area.
It does so by providing a map view that links to issues and conversations.
Issues can be opened/closed/re-opened, similar to the way a technical 
issue tracker would work.
