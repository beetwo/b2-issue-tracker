# Toucan Project Planning


## Modifications for SOS Children's Villages International

Some meetings were held in early 2018 to adopt Toucan to the needs 
of SOS Children's Villages International. A number of feature requests 
were opened on the Github Issue Tracker and some updated Screens created.
These screens can be seen on InVision 
[here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/TYFW4KAJ8ZU#/screens/279818081).
