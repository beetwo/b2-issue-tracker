User : A user of the Toucan platform. Organization : A collective of users working together on the Toucan platform. Organizations have regular members and administrators. Regular members can create issues on behalf of their organisation. Administrators can invite further members to the organization and change certain settings for their organisation (such as description).

Administrators can reach the Admin interface via a link at the top right of the profile page. They will be greeted by an interface similar to the following screenshot: The actual interface might be slightly different, depending on the permissions your user has configured. From here the steps easy: Find the section Organisations and either click on Organisations to get a listing of all currently registered Organisations or use the \"Add\" shortcut. You will be presented with a form where you will be able to create a new organisation. Only a few fields (such as name and short name) are required and adminitrators are advised to only fill out the minimum required information. Locations, Logo etc. can all be safely skipped, organisation administrators can edit these properties through the main interface at a later point. One aspect of the form is important if you intend to invite users to the organisation right away. At the end of the organisation form you will find the following fields: Here you are able to enter email addresses and choose the role the invited person will receive as soon as he signs up. It makes sense to invite a single email address during creation and assign him the admin role for the organisation. This way he will be able to invite additional members to the organisation by himself.","title":"Adding an organization"},{"location":"developers/local_installation/","text":"Local Installation This guide assumes a working knowledge of command line usage and familiarity with python tooling Prerequisites for a local installation. Python 3 Pipenv PostgreSQL (>=9.4) PostGIS Redis Node.js Backend Dependencies To install the required packages change into the project directory and execute pipenv install This command creates the virtual environment and installs all dependencies. To activate the created environment type: pipenv shell Under Linux it might be necessary to install additional dev-packages such as libjpeg-dev , zlibc , python-dev and libpg-dev through your distributions package manager. Set a secret key cp toucan_conf/settings/secrets.example.py toucan_conf/settings/secrets.py Open toucan_conf/settings/secrets.py and set SECRET_KEY to some string. Load the default categories While not required it is strongly suggested to add some default categories for your installation. These can be added to/changed/deleted from the administrative interface. ./manage.py loaddata toucan/fixtures/issueTypes.json Database The application requires a PostgreSQL installation (>=9.4) with a database named toucan . Configure the database connection by extending the DATABASES object in issues_tracker/settings/__init__.py : DATABASES = { 'default': { 'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis', 'NAME': 'toucan', 'USER': 'postgres', 'PASSWORD': 'postgres', 'HOST': 'localhost', 'PORT': 5434 } } To create the database scheme run the migrations (this might require PostgreSQL superuser rights to install the postgis extension): ./manage.py migrate Build Frontend The frontend part of the code is to be found in the 'frontend' folder. To install the build tools and dependencies of the frontend issue the following commands from within that folder. Note: use either the yarn or the npm commands, both should result in the same packages being installed. npm install or yarn install Finally build the frontend assets npm run build-dev or yarn build-dev Development Frontend Start the development server so that the frontend is automatically rebuilt when a file is modified. In the ./frontend folder run the following command npm run dev or yarn dev For fearless frontend developers there is also the option to enable hot module replacement. npm run hmr or yarn hmr This will start a server to do the static file hosting on 127.0.0.1:8080 and skip the django dev server for the built frontend files. Frontend Maps By default the openstreetmaps service is used as the tile source for the mapping components. If you intend to use mapbox tiles during development create a .env file inside the frontend folder and add a line similar to this one to it: MAPBOX_API_KEY=<mapbox-api-key> The API key can be found inside your mapbox account's settings. Backend Make sure you have activated the virtual environment: source env/bin/activate Make sure a Redis server is running and listening on port 6379.
