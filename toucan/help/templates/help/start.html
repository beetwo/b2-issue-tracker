        Toucan is currently under heavy development and we are aware of the fact that documentation is sparse.<br />
        Until we get these issues sorted out, here are some resources that you might be interested in.
    </p>

    <h2>Feature Guide</h2>

    <p>
        A feature guide that is intended for new users is available. It highlights some of the basic concepts when working with Toucan.

{#            <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i>&nbsp;#}
            Go to Feature Guide
        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>User Manual</h2>
    <p>
        A user manual was created that is intended to help early adopters through the basics of Toucan.
        It is slightly outdated, but the general concepts apply to the current version you are using right now.
