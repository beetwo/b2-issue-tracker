            <p>
                On Toucan you are notified when another organisation creates an issue. In order to avoid an overflow of
                notifications, you can select for which organisation and what kind of issue you want to be notified on
                in a geographic radius. If an issue matching your criteria is created you will be notified immediately
                and can help resolve it.

                On Toucan you can reach individuals and organisations that would otherwise not be able see your requests
                for help. Therefore a user can directly mention a person or an organization. In order to make sure you
                only get notified on what you want to be notified on, choose what kind of notification you receive when
                you or your organisation get mentioned.
