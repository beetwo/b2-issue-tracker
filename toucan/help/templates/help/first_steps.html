                Get notified on what is relevant to you

                <p>

            <p>
                On Toucan you are notified when another organisation creates an issue. In order to avoid an overflow of
                notifications, you can select for which organisation and what kind of issue you want to be notified on
                in a geographic radius. If an issue matching your criteria is created you will be notified immediately
                and can help resolve it.

            <p>
                A big part of the value proposition of Toucan is that you
                can reach people and organisations that would otherwise not be able see your requests
                for help.<br/>
                Of course there are always cases where you might want to address people/organisations
                directly and for this reason Toucan has a user notification system built-in.
                You as a user can decide if and how you want to be notified of certain actions that
                happen in Toucan.<br/>
